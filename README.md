# Keep Your Inbox Safe (KYIS): Transformer-Based Email Threat Detection

## Part 1: Introduction
Email security threats have become increasingly sophisticated, outpacing many traditional detection mechanisms. Modern malicious emails encompass a wide range of attacks, including phishing, spam, malware-laden messages, scam/fraud attempts, and business email compromise (BEC) schemes. In response to these evolving risks, the objective of **Keep Your Inbox Safe (KYIS)** is to create an advanced neural network-based classification system that accurately identifies various types of email threats.

Rather than simply fine-tuning an existing transformer model (such as BERT), we will focus on **designing a custom transformer-inspired architecture** from scratch specifically tailored to the nuances of next-generation email threats. By introducing new structural elements and comparing them against state-of-the-art solutions, we aim to offer valuable insights into improving email security.

## Part 2: High-Level Solution

### Custom Neural Network Architecture
KYIS will employ a from-scratch neural network design inspired by transformer architectures. Although transformers like BERT provide an excellent foundation for text processing, our goal is to build a custom model that thoroughly addresses the context-specific features of email data. To achieve this, we will experiment with different configurations—such as varying model depth, attention heads, and feed-forward layer sizes—to find the balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing
A robust data preprocessing phase ensures that our custom model receives high-quality inputs:

1. **Text Cleaning:** Removing extraneous symbols, HTML tags, and hidden characters.  
2. **Tokenization & Vectorization:** Converting raw text into sequences of tokens and numerical embeddings that are compatible with neural networks.  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Identifying relevant meta-features (sender addresses, header patterns, embedded URLs) that may boost detection performance.

### Multi-Class Classification
We will initially categorize emails into three major classes: **phishing, spam, and benign**. However, we will also design the model to easily incorporate additional malicious categories in the future—such as **spear-phishing** and **BEC**. The ability to adapt to emerging threats is a priority, ensuring that KYIS remains effective as adversaries evolve their tactics.

### Comparison with State-of-the-Art Models
An integral part of our project involves benchmarking KYIS against established industry or research-level solutions. We plan to:
- **Fine-Tune and Evaluate** pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and T5 on the same dataset.  
- **Conduct Head-to-Head Comparisons** using consistent evaluation protocols and metrics.  
- **Identify Strengths and Weaknesses** of both KYIS and the competitor models to make further improvements.

### Evaluation and Validation
Measuring performance will involve commonly used metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. To avoid overfitting, we will employ cross-validation strategies and keep an isolated test set for final evaluation. Additionally, we will compare KYIS against traditional spam filters and simpler machine learning classifiers to establish a performance baseline.

## Part 3: Data Requirements
Ensuring high-quality, representative data is critical for building a reliable email classification model. We plan to divide our data into three subsets:

1. **Training Set (80%)** – Used to **learn** model parameters. This subset will contain a balanced distribution of phishing, spam, and benign emails where feasible.  
2. **Validation Set (10%)** – Used for hyperparameter tuning and early **performance checks**. This will ensure the model’s design choices generalize to data not used during training, mitigating overfitting.  
3. **Test Set (10%)** – Held out until the final phase to **evaluate** the model under realistic conditions.

### Potential Data Sources
- **OpenPhish** and **PhishTank**: Repositories with verified phishing emails.  
- **Enron Email Dataset**: A large corpus of legitimate corporate emails.  
- **SpamAssassin Public Corpus**: A well-known dataset for spam email detection.   
- **Manually Collected/Generated Samples**: High-value examples for specialized threats (e.g., spear-phishing & BEC, etc).

## Part 4: Considerations and Challenges

1. **Custom Model Design Complexity**  
   Striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency is essential. Since we aim to classify emails in near real-time, the model must be optimized for both speed and accuracy. Additionally, the design must handle a diverse range of writing styles, file types, and languages.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   While textual analysis is primary, metadata-based features (e.g., IP addresses, domain reputations, email header anomalies) can provide important cues. Identifying and integrating these features effectively could significantly enhance the model’s robustness.

3. **Handling Imbalanced Data**  
   Phishing emails are typically less frequent than spam or benign emails, which risks biasing the model toward majority classes. We will use techniques like **oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation** to manage data imbalance.

4. **Adversarial Attacks & Evasion Techniques**  
   Malicious actors frequently update their strategies to bypass existing defenses. We will investigate adversarial training methods —i.e., introducing slightly altered phishing examples during training to build resilience against such threats.

5. **Real-Time Performance & Scalability**  
   Organizations often require instant email filtering. This necessitates us to explore optimizations like model pruning, weight quantization, or lighter architectures that can be deployed at scale (e.g., in a cloud environment).

## Part 5: Next Steps

Our development of KYIS will be iterative, continually evolving to tackle challenges encountered during its lifecycle:

1. **Model Construction & Initial Training**  
   Implement a transformer-inspired network, tune hyperparameters, and establish a performance baseline using the training and validation sets.

2. **Data Augmentation & Threat Simulation**  
   Generate synthetic phishing emails to increase data variety and incorporate adversarial examples to fortify the model’s defenses.

3. **Benchmarking & Refinement**  
   Compare KYIS to state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers, simpler machine learning approaches, or existing research work in the literature. Use these insights to refine the architecture and model performance.

By proactively planning and implementing these stages, we aim to deliver a robust, scalable, and explainable system for classifying and managing diverse email threats. Through the combination of innovative architecture design and comparative testing with different models, we will demonstrate a deeper understanding and effective solution to modern email security challenges.
