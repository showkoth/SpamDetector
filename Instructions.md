# Keep Your Inbox Safe (KYIS): Transformer-Based Email Threat Detection

This is our Neural Networks project that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify spam/ham emails fron the Enron dataset.

## Requirements

- Access to Google Colab
- GPU Runtime
- High-speed internet connection

## Required Files

Ensure that the dataset is present in the following github repo:

- [`Enron Email Dataset`](https://github.com/MWiechmann/enron_spam_data/raw/master/enron_spam_data.zip) -- This is our dataset for this project.

## Instructions to Run the Project

1. Open the notebooks in Google Colab. We have 4 notebooks for this project in /notebooks directory.

2. Execute each cell sequentially from top to bottom, following the notebook instructions.

3. After completing all steps, you should obtain results matching those presented in in the report.

## Important Note

- Model training is time-intensive. Enable GPU acceleration in Colab runtime settings to significantly speed up the process.
